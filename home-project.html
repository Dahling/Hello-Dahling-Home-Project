      <p class="lead">Dahling, has anyone ever told you how wonderful you truly are?</p>
      <p><mark><strong>I sure hope so.</mark></strong> If someone has said otherwise, here's what to do... First think of what they've said. When you see what they've said, in your mind's eye, do the following: <del>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</del>Thereafter, replace it with this affirmation: <u>YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!</u></p>
      <h2>FAQS</h2>
      <h3>Where did "Hello Dahling" come from?</h3>
      <p class="text-left">During my life in LA, I attended an acting class. During that class, I fell in love with many people, including one particular girl who will forever remain in my life. That girl's name is Delila (insert swoon-emoji). During one time or another, we began playing around as our actress-like-selves, speaking in British accents --especially when leaving each other voicemails...</p>
      <p class="text-center"><strong>"Hellllllo, Dahling," Delila was said, in the most perfect British accent. In continued British accent, she would tell me all sorts of wonderful things, like... "Dahling, I think we ought to go to the Korean Spa. Let's go lay on the healing Jade floor."</strong></p>
      <p class="text-right">In return, I might <strong>surely</strong> leave a little <strong>British accent</strong> voicemail for Delila; and, it would quite possibly go something like this: "Hellllllo Dahhhhling! I miss you, dearly. Shall we head to the beach, followed by wishful plans to directly, thereafter, proceed to go and buy adorable little puppies?</p>
      <p class="text-justify">And, mind you --<strong>YES, you, Dahling, YOU... YOU, the one is reading thy words that I presently type.</strong>Please note: these words are also being typed during the time in which I speak them allowed, in a British accent --just as a Dahling would do.</p>
